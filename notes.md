# Todo list
- [ ] Add loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.
  - [ ] Long-range loop closure, which will estimate the correspondence via the mast3r model (more robust than other matching method)
    - [ ] Also, criteria based on the pose estimation
  - [ ] Short-term loop closure, here, short-term means the loop detection is out of the sliding window, just make it more robust, still based on the netvlad.
- [ ] Self-calibrated layer in the bundle adjustment.
  - [ ] The self-calibrated layer is the layer that can be optimized in the bundle adjustment, which is the layer that can be optimized in the bundle adjustment.
